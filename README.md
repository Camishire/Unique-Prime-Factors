# Unique-Prime-Factors
In the range [L, R], find the integer that has the maximum number of unique prime factors.
If there is more than one such number, find the greatest one.
In number theory, prime factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of prime integers.
E.â€‰g. the number 24 has 4 prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 3. The unique factors are 2 and 3.

Input :
Two integers L, R (0 < L < R < 10^7).

Output :
Output the number x that has the maximum number of unique prime factors and belongs to the interval [L, R].
If there are multiple answers, output the maximum one.
